Wei, "Joint-Scnn: Joint Spiking Convolution Network for Direction of Arrival Estimation," in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, doi: 10.1109/TVT.2024.3415438. keywords: {Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Neurons;Sensor arrays;Covariance matrices;Multiple signal classification;Vectors;Direction of arrival;spiking neural network;tandem learning;transfer learning},
  
*Note that:
1) The class of our method and method using the original tandem learning are respectively sResnet7_v2 and sResnet7 in model.py.
2) The matlab code .m files in this project are responsible for generation of the relavent training/evaluation datasets, which were used in Ref [7].
3) If training methods, please fix and run cnn_R_low.py.
4) All evaluation codes are included in other codes in this project.
