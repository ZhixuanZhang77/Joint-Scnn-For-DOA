*Note that:
1) The class of our method and method using the original tandem learning are respectively sResnet7_v2 and sResnet7 in model.py.
2) The matlab code .m files in this project are responsible for generation of the relavent training/evaluation datasets, which were used in Ref [7].
3) If training methods, please fix and run cnn_R_low.py.
